While cleaning up my macbook, something that I noticed is that when I look at the Mac storage is that there is a very large chunk that takes up a massive amount of memory (almost 100GB), but the mac itself cannot figure out what is causing that. Thus, this project aims to solve that issue by explicitely searching. Might add AI later to figure out the source of the large files as well.
